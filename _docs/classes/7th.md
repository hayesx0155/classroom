## Agenda

### 1. Journal

The holiday season is a time of celebration, which often revolves around food. From harvesting crops to transporting goods to local stores, technology plays a major role in getting our holiday meals onto our tables. Check out this video: [Transforming the Food Industry with Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtgCVfPdlNo).

**Prompt:** Reflect on how technology has changed the way we grow, distribute, and purchase food. In what ways does technology make food more affordable and accessible during the holiday season? Are there any negative effects of relying on technology for our food supply? Write a paragraph explaining your thoughts with examples.

# November 12, 2024

## 1. Journal Entry

Choose a current event that interests you or impacts your community.

- In a paragraph, briefly summarize the event and explain how it relates to any of the concepts we’ve been learning in class (e.g., problem-solving, technology, or data analysis).

- In a second paragraph, reflect on how advancements in computer science or technology could play a role in addressing this event or similar issues in the future.

## 2. Python Coding Project

I've posted an out line for your Python Project. I will provide more detailed instructions by next week. This week, you should focus on your project proposal. You can find the project details [here](https://github.com/mswhitby/WHSTechNotes/blob/main/cs1_project.md).

# November 4, 2024

## Agenda

### Journal Entry

In today’s digital world, sharing and publishing content online is more common than ever. Whether you’re contributing to a project, posting on social media, or submitting work for class, it’s important to think about the kinds of information you’re sharing and how it can be used.

Reflect on the following questions:

1. Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online?

2. What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure?

3. Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now?

4. How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy?

Write a paragraph or more considering these questions. Include examples of actions you can take to safeguard your own data, and reflect on why being cautious online is important for your personal and professional life.

The Benefits and Risks of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries like healthcare, education, and business, but it also comes with challenges. In this journal entry, write about how AI has the potential to help improve our lives. Then, consider some ways in which AI could cause harm, especially in areas like privacy, jobs, and security. Be sure to support your thoughts with examples for both sides.

- Helpful: How does AI improve efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, or transportation?
- Harmful: What are some risks AI poses, such as job automation, bias in algorithms, or cybersecurity threats?

Write two paragraphs—one focusing on the benefits and one on the potential risks.

You can use the following resources to inform your response:

Last week we looked at computer science jobs. This week we'll look at applying computer science to jobs in any industry. I'd like you to consider why is learning to code valuable regardless of the industry you choose to work in?

Write a paragraph or more focused on the following:

1. How can coding improve problem-solving skills?
2. How might understanding code help you in industries that aren’t directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education?
3. How does coding enhance creativity or collaboration?

Provide examples where coding knowledge might benefit professionals in various fields. Remember to use specific examples and reflect on how coding can impact your future career path, even if it’s not directly related to computer science.

## Weekly Journal Prompt

In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?

In your response, consider the following:

- How does precision affect the outcome of a program?
- What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?
- Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?

Remember to use Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to structure your response.

- Wait for further instructions.

## Weekly Journal Prompt

_Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process_

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.
